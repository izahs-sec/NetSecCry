<summary><strong>The enemy knows the system</strong></summary>

> **“yep.”**

This principle, commonly associated with **Claude Shannon** and **Kerckhoffs’s Principle**, states that a secure system must remain secure even if the attacker knows everything about the system except the secret key.

**Key ideas:**
- The algorithm is public  
- Only the key is secret  
- Security must not rely on obscurity

<summary><strong>Terminology</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cryptology</strong></summary>

Cryptology is the **overall science of secure communication**, encompassing both the creation of cryptographic systems and the analysis used to break them.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cryptography</strong></summary>

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for **secure communication** in the presence of adversaries.  
It focuses on designing encryption schemes, protocols, and secure systems.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cryptanalysis</strong></summary>

Cryptanalysis is the study of **breaking cryptographic systems**—analyzing ciphertexts to recover plaintext or keys without authorization.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cipher</strong></summary>

A cipher is an **algorithm** used to perform encryption and decryption.  
It defines how plaintext is transformed into ciphertext and back again.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Key</strong></summary>

A key is a **secret value** used by a cipher to control the encryption and decryption process.  
Security depends on keeping the key secret, not the algorithm.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Plaintext</strong></summary>

Plaintext is the **original, readable message or data** before encryption.  
It can be understood directly without cryptographic processing.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ciphertext</strong></summary>

Ciphertext is the **encrypted form of plaintext**, produced using a cipher and a secret key.  
It appears unreadable without proper decryption.
