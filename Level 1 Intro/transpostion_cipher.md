# Columner Transpostion Cipher

write a short breif then add this to the example dropdown 
ZEBRAS is of length 6 (so the rows are of length 6), and the permutation is defined by the alphabetical order of the letters in the keyword. In this case, the order would be "6 3 2 4 1 5".

In a regular columnar transposition cipher, any spare spaces are filled with nulls; in an irregular columnar transposition cipher, the spaces are left blank. Finally, the message is read off in columns, in the order specified by the keyword. For example, suppose we use the keyword ZEBRAS and the message WE ARE DISCOVERED. FLEE AT ONCE. In a regular columnar transposition, we write this into the grid as follows:

6 3 2 4 1 5
W E A R E D
I S C O V E 
R E D F L E 
E A T O N C 
E Q K J E U 
providing five nulls (QKJEU), these letters can be randomly selected as they just fill out the incomplete columns and are not part of the message. The ciphertext is then read off as:

EVLNE ACDTK ESEAQ ROFOJ DEECU WIREE


# double transpostion cipher
add some short breif


The double transposition cipher can be treated as a single transposition with a key as long as the product of the lengths of the two keys. add some short info about this line
